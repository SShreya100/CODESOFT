# CODESOFT
This repository contains the tasks and projects completed during my internship at Codesoft. The internship focused on enhancing my skills in software development, problem-solving, and real-world application of programming concepts.


🚢 Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
Built a logistic regression model to predict Titanic passenger survival using the dataset.

🔹 Key Steps:
Handled missing values and encoded categorical data.

Dropped irrelevant columns (Name, Ticket, Cabin).

Trained and evaluated a logistic regression model.

Visualized performance with a confusion matrix.

🛠️ Tools:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

📺 Task 4: Sales Prediction using Linear Regression
Built a linear regression model to predict product sales based on TV advertising spend using the Advertising dataset.

🔹 Key Steps:
Explored and visualized relationships between features.

Trained a linear regression model on TV ad spend.

Evaluated performance using MSE and R² score.

Plotted regression line vs. actual sales.

🛠️ Tools:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

💳 Task 5: Credit Card Fraud Detection
Developed a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a Random Forest classifier.

🔹 Key Steps:
Scaled features using StandardScaler.

Handled class imbalance with SMOTE.

Trained a Random Forest on resampled data.

Evaluated using confusion matrix and classification report.

🛠️ Tools:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
